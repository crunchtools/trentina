"""The one crossing: one request, two edges, in an order only this module knows.

Every request Trentina mediates is one crossing with two edges — the request
edge carries what the agent said toward the world, the response edge carries
what the world said back — and both run from here. ``crossing`` sequences a
transport's halves (``transports.base``) in the ONE order that is the security
property: parse the request, carry it, deliver the response, wrap it. A
transport supplies the protocol; it does not get to choose the order, so it
cannot skip the gate (Trentina 3.0 plan §A/§C).

Phase 4 state: ``crossing`` drives the MCP ``tools/call`` path for a profile
flagged ``orchestrated``, composing the gateway's existing collaborators
through ``transports.mcp`` so its output is byte-identical to the hand-rolled
``gateway/router.py`` path it will replace. The ``edge()`` Part mechanism (the
one home for paging and streaming), the stage types it produces, and the
``Posture`` it carries arrive in the later Phase 4 PRs as logic moves off the
router and into here.
